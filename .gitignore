# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
# .bundle is configured based on local environment variables

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
#binary files? 
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
#local db files, duplicative of migrations and seeds info but also possibly containint authentication info? 

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
# local files frequently rewritten.  No need for these on other instals
